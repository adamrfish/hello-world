# hello-world
Hi, my name is Adam Fish and I'm based in San Francisco. I'm currently learning to code and am excited to explore the many possibilities that this skill can open up for me. In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors and staying active â€“ I'm a good athlete and love participating in sports and other physical activities. I'm looking forward to continuing my journey as a coder and building new skills and experiences along the way.
